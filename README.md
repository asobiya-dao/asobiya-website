Hey there, awesome asobiya member! Welcome to the Asobiya website project's GitHub repository. We're so glad you're here to help us make this project shine! This README will guide you through the process of contributing to our open-source web development project in the most playful way possible.

## Setting up your local environment

To get started, follow these simple steps:

1. Please use `yarn` â€” convert any `npm` or `pnmp` commands you would use to `yarn` commands
2. Clone the repository (fork it first if needed)
3. `cd` to your repository and run `yarn` to install all modules
4. Run `yarn dev` to start a live reloading server while you work
5. Before committing your work, please run `yarn build` to make sure that your code will build

## Contribution Guidelines

Let your creativity flow and keep these guidelines in mind:

Create a new branch for every feature or bug fix you're working on. Give it a playful name to inspire your fellow contributors!
Don't be afraid to experiment! Try out new ideas, and if something doesn't work, just shake it off (like Taylor Swift) and try something different.
Write clean and understandable code. Remember, future contributors will appreciate your clarity.
